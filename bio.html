                <p style="margin-top: 0;">He was a French painter wide known for his work on impressionist movement. But the fact that some of his paintings are 
                realists until 1860s middles is something to be highlighted. Born in the 14th of november 1840, Paris, Claude was the second of 
                two sons.</p>
                <p>Founder of impressionism, name which came from his painting called <i>Impression, sunrise</i>, he 
                acquired a style in which the same scenario is captured but is presenta change in light and season 
                (i.e. <i>Water Lilies series</i>). He's said to have influenced artists as <i>Renoir</i>, <i>Cezzane</i> and <i>Van Gogh</i>. Monet was notably recognised for works such as <i>Impression, sunries</i>, <i>Rouen Cathedral</i>, <i>Water Lilies</i> and 
                <i>Haystacks Polars</i>.</p>
                <p>Most part of his life he lived poor, his works were ignored because of his disattachment of the main flow movement of his time.
                As few of his paintings are available on market, those can actually get astronomical prices on auction markets. The painter also had two children and died in Giverny, fifth of december 1926.</p>

                            <p>Impressionism is an art movement <i>en plein air</i> born in Paris, nineteenth century, in which the movements 
                                come to be an essential part along with light dynamics instead of having an accurate depiction of the scene as usual.</p>
                            <p>"<i><strong>Monet</strong>, with a scientific precision, has given us an unparalleled and unexcelled record of the 
                                passing of time as seen in the movement of light over identical forms.</i>" Helen Gardner</p>
