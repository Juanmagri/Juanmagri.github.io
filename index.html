                            of impressionism, term which comes from the title of his painting <em>Impression, Sunrise</em>.

                        <p>He developed paintings in which he had the same scene with different light as the seasons evolved, 
                            something that is known as <em>series</em>. The most recognised of the called before was the 
                            <em>Water Lilies</em>  series. Some people believed that the way he painted was because of his 
                            cataracts, altough it was something of his late days.</p>

                            <p>Impressionism is an art movement born in Paris, nineteenth century, in which the movements come to 
                                be an essential part of it along with light dynamics <em>en plein air</em> instead of having an 
                                accurate depiction of the scene.</p>
                            <p>"<i><strong>Monet</strong>, with a scientific precision, has given us an unparalleled and unexcelled record of the 
                                passing of time as seen in the movement of light over identical forms.</i>" Helen Gardner</p>
