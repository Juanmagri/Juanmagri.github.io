                        <p>He developed paintings in which he had the same scene with different light as the seasons evolved, 
                            something that is known as <em>series</em>. The most known of the named before was the 
                            <em>Water Lilies</em>  series. Some people believed that the way he painted was because of his 
                            cataracts.</p>
